Home Projects

My final project is a web application called Home Projects. It is a place to plan and budget projects for furnishing or renovating a house.

You create a project, within that project you add costs, eg. wooden flooring. Each cost will consist of the name of the cost,
the units it is measured in (e.g. litres for paint, metres squared for tiles etc.), the price of each unit, how many units you need and your currency.
The total cost of each entry is then calculated.

Each project will then display each cost associated with that project and calculate the total project cost.
